    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="lead">Last updated: October 16, 2025</p>
    <p class="lead">This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>MercinaryDev</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use the <strong>UnveilHex</strong> mobile application.</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>1. About This Policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the UnveilHex mobile application and any related services provided by MercinaryDev. By downloading, installing, or using UnveilHex, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Developer / Data Controller</h2>
    <p><strong>Developer:</strong> MercinaryDev<br>
    <strong>Contact email:</strong> <a href="mailto:mercenary.devs@gmail.com">mercenary.devs@gmail.com</a></p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Summary — What We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Location data:</strong> Collected while the app runs (foreground or background, if you permit it) to enable exploration, track visited areas, and the core app experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Device & usage data:</strong> Non-personal technical data collected by ad networks and/or analytics tools (e.g., device model, OS version, app usage events). We only collect what is necessary for basic analytics and advertising when these services are enabled.</li>
      <li><strong>No account info or personal identifiers:</strong> UnveilHex does not require account registration and does not collect names, emails, or other personal identifiers except the contact email you provide voluntarily (e.g., for support requests).</li>
      <li><strong>Ads data:</strong> The app displays ads. Ad providers may collect information required to personalize and deliver ads (see &ldquo;Third-party services&rdquo; below).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Detailed Information Collected</h2>
    <h3>Location</h3>
    <p>We use device location to provide the core functionality of UnveilHex — namely, revealing map zones and tracking exploration progress. Location is used locally on your device to calculate which zones you have visited.</p>
    <p><strong>When is location collected?</strong> Only when you grant the app permission to access location. You can disable location permissions in your device settings; doing so will limit the app's functionality.</p>

    <h3>Device & Usage Data</h3>
    <p>We may use ad networks and analytics SDKs that collect non‑identifying technical information such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device model and OS version</li>
      <li>App version and crash reports</li>
      <li>Basic usage metrics (e.g., session length, in‑app events)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is used to improve the app, measure performance, and (if applicable) personalize ads.</p>

    <h3>Advertisements</h3>
    <p>UnveilHex shows in‑app advertisements. Ad networks may collect information about your device and activity to serve ads and measure advertising performance. We do not control the data collection practices of third‑party ad networks — see <em>Third‑party services</em> below.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. How We Use Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and operate the app&rsquo;s core features (map revealing, tracking visited zones).</li>
      <li>To display and personalize advertising.</li>
      <li>To analyze and improve app performance and reliability.</li>
      <li>To respond to support requests sent to <a href="mailto:mercenary.devs@gmail.com">mercenary.devs@gmail.com</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Data Storage & Retention</h2>
    <p>UnveilHex stores exploration progress (XP, visited areas) locally on the device. We do not maintain a central cloud database or profile store for normal usage. If you uninstall the app, locally stored progress may be removed by the device OS.</p>
    <p>Logs and crash reports collected by analytics/ad SDKs may be retained by those providers according to their policies.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Third‑Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use third‑party services for advertising and analytics. These providers may collect data necessary to operate their services. Typical providers include (but are not limited to):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google AdMob / Google Play Services</li>
      <li>Other ad networks and demand partners</li>
      <li>Analytics providers (e.g., Firebase Analytics)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of the relevant providers to understand their data practices. We do not control these third parties&rsquo; data collection and processing.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Location & Background Access</h2>
    <p>If UnveilHex requests background location permission, this access is requested only to enable continuous exploration tracking and to reveal zones when the app is not active. Android and iOS may require a separate permission for background location; you can revoke these permissions at any time through your device settings.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>UnveilHex is intended for users aged 13 and older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:mercenary.devs@gmail.com">mercenary.devs@gmail.com</a> so we can take steps to remove that information.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>10. Your Rights & Choices</h2>
    <p>You control the permissions granted to UnveilHex via your device settings. You may:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Revoke location access (will limit app functionality).</li>
      <li>Opt out of personalized ads where supported by your device/ad provider (see Google Ad Settings).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To request deletion of any data we hold (limited, since we do not maintain user profiles in the cloud), contact <a href="mailto:mercenary.devs@gmail.com">mercenary.devs@gmail.com</a>. We will respond to verifiable requests within a reasonable time consistent with applicable law.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>11. Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable measures to protect data on devices and to use secure connections when communicating with third‑party services. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>12. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Because we may rely on third‑party providers located in other countries, data processed by those providers may be transferred internationally. If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the UK, those transfers will be subject to applicable law and any safeguards implemented by the third party.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>13. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will update the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.</p>
